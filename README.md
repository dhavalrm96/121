# In this project, we have built a machine learning model to predict the house prices of an Indian city(Bengaluru).
This project will very helpful for the real estate market.
Our model can be used by both house sellers and house buyers.
Multiple Linear Regression algorithm is used to create a model with a great accuracy score.
Prices of real estate properties are sophisticatedly linked with our economy. 
Despite this, we do not have accurate measures of house prices based on the vast amount of data available. 
Proper and justified prices of properties can bring in a lot of transparency and trust back to the real estate industry, which is very important for most consumers especially in India.
The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Bengaluru city based on some features such as location, size/area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
 Bengaluru house price dataset is used to create the model.
 We are using Machine Learning Algorithm to create a predictive model. 
Multiple Linear Regression algorithm is used to train and test the model in our project.
